## BBB prediction
This repository contains our final project in Applied Case Studies of ML and DL in Key Areas 2, BSc in Data Science and AI, SUPSI AY 2023-24
The folders data, result and utils contain some of the more extensive functions used in the analysis, while the executable jupyter notebook is named 'BBB classification', where in the last cell the user can interact with the model, getting explainable prediction.
A report can also be found.
The code is also equipped with a util named "rfcv" which provides a visual analysis on the entire dataset about feature importance. Its usage is left to the interested user, the function is already implemented and only needs a dataframe as an input. 

We hope you can have fun with it!
